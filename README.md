## I. Introduction
<a name="background"></a>
### 1. Background
To get a better idea of why sorting plays such a key role in our lives and the world of programming, let us look at an example. Imagine you have a jumbled deck of 52 cards, and in this case, sorting them in a specific order is simple. If there are thousands of jumbled cards, sorting is not that easy. In the context of Computer Science, the same problem arises when we try to manipulate and organize a marvelous amount of unsorted amount of data. In such cases, the need for sorting algorithms becomes clear. By understanding the mechanics, use cases, advantages, and disadvantages of each sorting algorithm, we can pick out the best fit for our specific requirements and, as a result, minimize the cost of time and memory in solving larger programming problems. Unfortunately, it is never easy to grab a complete understanding of all sorting algorithms, as they vary vastly from each other, and each has a different use case. Therefore, we chose sorting algorithms as the core factor for our project to revise what we have learnt in the theory classes and put the coding skills we have learnt in practice.

## IV. Website version
 Through this project, I hope to bring out an educational tool, which provides users with a user-friendly, engaging, and personalized learning experience. This can be achieved by our fresher, eye-catching user interface, which is astrology-inspired and the addition of new features, which allows users to determine how the input of their sorting, and how their data will be sorted. 
 In website, I added: 
 <ul>
    <li> Create Chart to create a new chart with random input. </li>
    <li> A function to decide the speed of the sort. </li>
    <li> A function to select the number of charts to be sorted. </li>
    <li> Sort to sort and visualize the charts. </li>
    <li> Description to summarize the mechanic of the algorithm. </li>
</ul>
